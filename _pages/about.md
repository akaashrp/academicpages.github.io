I am an undergraduate at the Georgia Institute of Technology studying Computer Science and Mathematics with concentrations in Intelligence and Modeling & Simulation. My research interests include geometric deep learning, high-throughput computational simulations, scientific machine learning, and deep reinforcement learning. I am currently pursuing a Software Development Engineering internship at Amazon. 

At GT, I am conducting research with Prof. Victor Fung at the [Fung Group](https://www.fung-group.org), where I am broadly working on developing foundation graph neural networks for applications to materials chemistry. I am also working at the [Laboratory for Intelligent Decision and Autonomous Robots](https://lab-idar.gatech.edu), where I am investigating deep reinforcement learning approaches for decentralized multi-robot collision avoidance and navigation.

I have previously interned at EXL Service, where I developed end-to-end domain-agnostic document processing solutions and also worked on adapting techniques for few-shot learning to document image classification and custom named entity recognition. I have also worked at M2IOT Solutions, an Industrial IoT startup, as a Software Engineering Intern and at the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee as a Research Intern.
